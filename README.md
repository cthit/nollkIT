# General info

Wordpress theme for the current nollk.it.

*By Oscmage*

##Pre setup

Before git cloning this repo you should be aware of following.

* This is a theme for wordpress which means you will have to download
wordpress ( https://wordpress.org/download/ ) and set it up according to their docs ( https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress ). 

* Since php is used you will need some sort of local server to run it. My recommendation is MAMP ( https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).

* If you're new to wordpress i recommend you to take a look at (https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/wp-template-hierarchy.jpg).

## Setup

- After completing pre setup you will need to clone the repo into the folder -> /wp-content/themes/ 

by typing:

```
git clone git@github.com:cthit/nollkIT.git
```

- This theme uses scss for styling which means you will need some sort of "watcher" to convert the scss -> css.
More info about scss can be found ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)).

My suggestion for watchers is either sass (http://sass-lang.com/install) or a IDE like phpstorm.
